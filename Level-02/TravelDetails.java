/*
Create a program to take user inputs for name, cities (fromCity, viaCity, toCity), distances (fromToVia, viaToFinalCity),
and time taken for travel. Then, print the result.

Hint => 
1. Create variables for name, fromCity, viaCity, and toCity.
2. Create variables for distances (fromToVia and viaToFinalCity) in miles.
3. Take user input for the time taken for the journey.
4. Calculate and print the results, understanding the operator precedence.
I/P => name, fromCity, viaCity, toCity, fromToVia, viaToFinalCity, timeTaken
O/P => The journey details are: [name], from [fromCity] to [viaCity] to [toCity], with distances [fromToVia] miles, [viaToFinalCity] miles, and time taken [timeTaken] hours.
